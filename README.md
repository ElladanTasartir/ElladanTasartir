## Hey there! Thanks for coming

### About me:
 I'm a software engineer with approximately 5 years of experience, primarily focused on backend development. Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve worked extensively with Go, gRPC, and Kafka, building and maintaining high-performance 
 distributed systems and microservices. I also have experience with TypeScript, Node.js, and React, which allows me to navigate across different layers of the application. I have a solid track record of contributing to high- traffic, high-impact projects, playing an active role in architecture, scalability, and system resilience across the companies I've worked with.
